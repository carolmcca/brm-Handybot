# brm-Handybot

## Scope

HandyBot is an innovative project developed within the scope of the Bionics and Medical Robotics course at FEUP. It aims to address the existing challenges in the field of physical therapy by providing a solution that revolutionizes the rehabilitation process. It consists of a robotic arm and peripherals equipped with sensors and actuators capable of detecting and responding to muscle activation. 

The implementation of Handybot entails the design and development of a compact robotic arm system controlled through electromyography (EMG) signals. These signals, generated by muscle contractions, serve as indicators of movement intentions.
In this project, the team endeavors to create a scaled-down version of Handybot that can be controlled by muscle activation, offering a total of 4 degrees of freedom for control, including when the product is stationary. Users would be required to wear surface electrodes capable of capturing EMG data, enabling them to control and perform a variety of tasks such as object manipulation and lifting. The acquired EMG data is subsequently processed and analyzed by a computer, which then translates the information into corresponding movement instructions for the robot arm.

The project places a strong emphasis on minimizing the response time between arm movement and the resulting action of the Handybot. This optimization is essential to achieve enhanced usability, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience for the users.

## SUNFOUNDER Robot Arm

For this project, the SUNFOUNDER Robot Arm was used. The arm is powered by an Arduino Uno and driven by four servos, which provide precise joint control over its movements. These motors allow the robot arm to rotate at the base, move up and down, and bend at the arm's "elbow" and "wrist". Its main structure consists of several aluminum alloy parts, which make it sturdy and durable.

## OpenSignals and Bitalino

The project uses Bitalino for the EMG data acquisition. This data is transmited via Bluetooth to the computer using the OpenSignals Software. It then sends the data to MatLab using a TCP connection.
In order for the program to work, OpenSignals needs to be installed, pair to the bitalinos and the TCP connection activated.

## Project Files

DIY_Control_Robot_Arm_kit_for_Arduino-Rollarm-master: Folder with the Arduino code for the Robot Arm. It was developed based on the original code provided by the manufacture. The devoloped code is presented in "Rollarm.ino" file inside Rollarm folder.

test_led: code used to test the program outside lab class. Instead of trying to move the servos of the robot arm, we tested a program to change the intensity of different LEDs when subjected to different muscle activity.

handybot.m: MatLab code developed for the project. A better description on how it works can be found within the file.

triangleThreshold.m: Adaptive Threshold algorithm function used in the projected. The references for it can be found within the file

Helpers: a collection of scripts and files used to test and develop HandyBot along the path
